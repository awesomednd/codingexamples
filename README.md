### Example 2

Example 2 is used to show how you can print an Interger

[code](8.2/example2.py)

### Example 3

Example 3 is used to show how you can set the value of a variable to a string and how you can print the value of a variable and that you can add more than just one value to print

[code](8.2/example3.py)

### Example 4

Example 4 is used to show you can set the value of a variable to a Interger and how you can print text and the value of a variable.

[code](8.2/example4.py)

### Example 5

Example 5 is used to show how you can convert the string value of an input command and store it to a variable as well as how to use the input command and print the variable.

[code](8.2/example5.py)

### Example 6

Example 6 shows how to set the value of an input command to a variable and how to print the variable
